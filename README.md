Just a Bash script to install few gnome themes and icons files. 

Included Themes 
- Dracula

Before this 
keeping in mind you're using a chromium based browser
- Install chrome-gnome-shell from apt 
- open browser install gnome shell integration 
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep?hl=en
- install user themes extensions and others what you prefer
- install gnome tweaks

Now run the script it'll extract the theme files and place them in /usr/share/themes/ and /usr/share/icons
 cmd: sudo ./setup.sh

ps: I'll improve the script time to time to increase automation
